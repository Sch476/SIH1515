# Smart and Effective realtime Management of street parking

This repository contains the source code for a Smart Parking App built using React Native Expo. The app acquires data from CCTV cameras to monitor parking spaces and stores this data in a database. Users can then access real-time parking availability information and make parking reservations through the app.
